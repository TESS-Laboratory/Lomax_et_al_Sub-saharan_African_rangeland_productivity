# Analysis code for "The mean is what matters: African rangeland productivity appears robust to the temporal distribution of precipitation"
This repository contains R Markdown Notebooks and Google Earth Engine scripts for processing, visualising and analysing data presented in "The mean is what matters: African rangeland productivity appears robust to the temporal distribution of precipitation" by Guy Lomax, Andrew Cunliffe, Tom Powell, Theo Economou and Tim Lenton.

The code analyses the following datasets for the time period 2001-2019:
1. PML_V2 MODIS-based gross primary productivity data (Zhang et al., 2019; https://github.com/gee-hydro/gee_PML)
2. Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) daily precipitation data (https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps);
3. ERA5-Land reanalysis monthly averaged mean air temperature data (Mu√±oz Sabater, 2019; https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.68d2bb30);
4. MODIS mean daytime land surface temperature data (Wan et al., 2021; https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD11A1.061);
5. MODIS monthly burned area data (Giglio et al., 2015; https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD64A1.006);
6. iSDAsoil 30m African soil property maps (Hengl et al., 2021; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85639-y);

All data were accessed, pre-processed and exported using Google Earth Engine.
Google Earth Engine repository available here: https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/guylomax01/africa_rangeland_ppt_gpp_analysis.
Google Earth Engine intermediate assets can be found here: https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=projects/ee-guylomax01/assets/africa_rangeland_precipitation_gpp.
Earth Engine scripts are also made available directly on GitHub.

# Google Earth Engine scripts
**study_area_masks**: Processes and exports data layers defining the relevant study area (sub-Saharan African rangelands) for masking in R.
**season_variable_preparation**: Identifies mean and annual onset and cessation dates for the rainy season(s) in each pixel based on the CHIRPS daily rainfall dataset.
**main_variable_preparation**: Processes, resamples and exports all remaining (non-seasonal) data layers for masking and analysis in R.

# R Markdown Notebooks
**africa_rangelands_gam_analysis.Rmd**: Main analysis script. Imports and masks datasets from Earth Engine, generates exploratory figures, then fits non-spatial and spatial GAMs to the dataset and generates key results figures.
**seasonal_anomalies.Rmd**: Cleans season onset/cessation date datasets exported from Earth Engine to generate analysis-ready rasters of mean season length and standard deviation of season onset.
